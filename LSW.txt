The length of clear span: 8000 
Effective clear cover:30 
Total Depth of the beam(with clear cover):563 
Total Breadth of the beam 300 
concrete M25 
Steel Fe415 
Self weight of the beam 4 
Total uniformly distributed load on the beam including self wt. is 24 
Ultimate UDL after applyiny safety factor 1.5 is 36 
The effective length of the beam 8 
Beading moment on the both end of the beam 312 
Shear Force of the beam 150 
Now depth checking.
Required depth of the beam 549 
Provided depth of the beam 533 
so...
Maximum moment can be taken by the beam 294 
Bendign moment generate 312 
so ..
Area of the steel required 2070 
Provide 7  - 20mm phi @ tension side.
So, the area of the steel will be 2199 
Minimum and Maximum steel required in tension side 327and 6760 
so..
Nominal shear stress 0 
Persentage of nominal reinforcement 1 
From IS456:2000 tablw 19 critical shear will be 0 
As the critical shear is less than nominal shear so, we will provide vertical stirrups.
Shear resistance of concrete 115 
Shear carried by the stirrups 35 
Some spacing values for providing stirrups 543.5450856950844,  302.47254068762527,  400.0 
So, provide 8 mm phi 2LVS @ 300mm c/c.
